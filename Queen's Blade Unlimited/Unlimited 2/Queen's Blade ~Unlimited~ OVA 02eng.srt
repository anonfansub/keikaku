00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,650
Hey, Elina-sama!

154
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,730
Michel-san...

155
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,700
Yes?

156
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,860
Can we talk a little?

157
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,820
Yes.

158
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,570
That selfish person, what kind of relationship do you have?

159
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,250
Well...

160
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,130
If you're being treated so badly as to be taken off

161
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,820
I'll take a consultation

162
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,970
There's no need of it.

163
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
Is that so

164
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,530
This relieved me a little.

165
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,610
You are so gentle.

166
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,760
Tomoe-san, why are you fighting in qb?

167
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,991
I want to cure one's illness

168
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,430
100 I heard that there is Mantan on this continent

169
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:15,980
You can get the Queen's Blade if you keep winning

170
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
Tomoe-san?

171
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
Yes?

172
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,540
If you have a way to save others

173
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,290
would you use it without hesitation?

174
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
I would use.

175
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,280
For me, Queens Blade is the means is what makes it possible.

176
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,960

Just strong

185
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,520
Only the technique is fast

186
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,590
It looks beautiful

187
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,270
I'm tired of seeing what Queen's Blade

188
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,810
Well, I'm selfish

189
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,710
That's what being a queen is all about

190
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
Yes yes

191
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,290
I'm likely to empathize One has already decided

192
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,567
This is Tomoe

193
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,350
Oh, that girl.

194
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,340
The question is who the opponent is

195
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,200
If there are interesting Bitoushi, can you introduce me?

196
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,790
I have not appointed a beautiful fighter, but one person with few strong numbers

197
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,790
I can't escape in the morning and it's just right

198
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,935
From Niihama

199
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,130
The death of someone with the power to defeat what I want

200
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,670
Give to your master a harm welcome.

201
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,250
You smell like beer.

202
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,460
Dont you think its rude say a girl has bad smell?

203
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,790
Wait, huh?!

204
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,410
Where are y ou looking

205
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,680
Where training

206
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,240
take your time

207
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
Hey you

208
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,170
Dont tell me,

209
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,520
I wouldn't have been attacked by Tomoe

210
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,260
Huh?

211
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,140
That woman, In the life of Myochi Kirin

212
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,719
It was a ridiculously selfish atmospher e.

213
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,270
That's not true

214
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,020
I like that. I wonder if I also like black hair.

215
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,410
Now that I remember, It was Meros' black hair

216
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,543
It's not like that

217
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,359
Don't even know about you

218
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
If you blow this

219
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,800
I wonder if my sickness will cool down

220
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,890
Ora, I don't think I'm very motivated

221
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,890
Stop please.

222
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,330
If you do it that way, I will...

223
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,180
You say you cant but you are feeling good

224
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,790
Such as vulgar acts in such plac es

225
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,210
I just played a little more, but

226
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,920
By chance Am I frustrated?

227
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,720
If you think it's a lie

228
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:12,000
Well, I don't think you can make a good sound anyway.

229
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,690
If it is Tomoe, I have some knowledge.

230
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,470
You need to include more in my mouth

231
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,420
Michel-san,

232
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,730
I will save you, its a promisse.

233
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,640
I refuse

234
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,160
I'm rarely invited by friends, so maybe I should change it

235
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,400
I don't know if it's a match before you, but I was just a prospect

236
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,260
I have no time to participate in such things

237
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,180
The footsteps of your wonderful sister

238
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,050
I've finally served, so there seems to be a clue to how to get to Marks.

239
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,930
Headed to Mino Washi

240
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,090
Hinomoto.

241
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,270
Airi, where is the bitch miko?

242
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,170
Who knows, Even for early morning

243
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,490
I was think ing of asking him for directions to Hinomoto

244
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,730
I'm sloppy last night because I have a bad drinking habit

245
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,110
Elina-sama, drink too much is very bad

246
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,580
You should refrain a little. Noisy

247
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,670
So thats how it is

248
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:04,010
So I think it's better to have it at home in the morning

249
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,240
Numbness has healed

250
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,290
Its all right

251
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,290
I will fight

252
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,920
Interesting.

253
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,850
What do you   mean of me

254
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,050
That's what it seems.

255
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,760
Hey, Airi-san.

256
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,800
Is that...

257
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,580
Who im thinking?

258
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,500
Yes, that's Queen Aldra.

259
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,270
Menas-san!

260
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,700
So she is friend of the Queen.

261
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,280
I am the shrine maiden Tomoe

262
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,100
, the price of Queen Aldora, Yuuki

263
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,830
I want you to go into vulgarity, and I want all those who use this radio to finish looking at what justice is.

264
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,480
I want you to go into vulgarity, and I want all those who use this radio to finish looking at what justice is.

265
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,640
You used to say that the quality is poor. Last night

266
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,240
I will not forgot what I saw.

267
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,880
A boy's address that is too old

268
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,760
How do you handle those two because they belong to me

269
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,750
It's my self Touhou

270
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,030
In the name of Queen Aldra,

271
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,200
Model fighting

272
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,510
Do you two already decided?

273
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:46,390
If not decided, seven-colored eggs

274
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,880
Let me see, hum...

275
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,500

00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,010
Nao conte com isso.

277
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,530
I am the warriow of tempest, Elina!

278
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,700
Those who block the enemy disappear with the dew of the blade Chadame Warrior Miko Tomoe

279
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,900
Disappear for the blade

280
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,560
I'm always fighting Rei-chan YouTube

281
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,390
If I win, you will release the slave

282
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,820
What if I'm willing to be a slave  The person

283
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,375
Well, fine.

284
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,310
I wont lose anyway.

285
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,960
My request is Tomonkai

286
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,140

287
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,220

Oh, nothing bad.

293
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,430
I say the same.

294
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,360
Please support both

295
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,020
Thats obvious.

296
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:30,430
Tell me, Was Elina-sama serious about turning Tomo-san into her slave?

297
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,430
Are you worried for her?

298
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:37,730
Yes, she has a mission to fulfill

299
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,380
Thats news to me.

300
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,630

301
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,150
I wont allow it.

302
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,470
The victory is mine!

303
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,810

This is the end of the match

306
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
An the winner is...

307
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,688
Zetsuen no tsuisekisha, Elina!

308
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,240
Im so sorry, tenshi-sama.

309
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,952
It ’s unlikely that I ’ll  be able to serve as Ayaniwa.

310
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,790
I also won

311
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,710
You know what's going to happen

312
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
As an advantage

313
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,592
Named Samurai Miko Tomoe

314
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,270
You will take us Take me to the bottom hinomoto.

315
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,470
That's right if you make me a slave, so my husband

316
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,020
And my guide

317
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,250
It ’s not that bad to be naked

318
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
Elina

319
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,120
Niigata

320
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,448
He showed me the grace of a continental gladiator

321
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,264
Good to receive

322
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,616
That is my testimony

323
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:50,016
As long as Maru is information, it will help your journey.

324
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,830
Tomoe-san, take it.

325
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,090
This is that flute

00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,840
Try it

327
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,820
But are you sure?

328
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,470

329
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,810
After all, the soundIt do esn't come out

330
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,712
But

331
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
Tired

332
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,040
Hitomi or

333
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
Ivalide

334
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
by the way

335
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,648
Michel's flute has

336
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,440
Cures wounds and illness

337
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,488
Has a nice effect

338
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,536
So before the match

339
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,352
It was becoming

340
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,144
With this power

341
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,216
Maybe Tomoe's purpose could be fulfilled

342
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,540
I really wanted to teach you sooner

343
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:54,010
Bikun Bikun and that were so fierce and far from that

344
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,240
