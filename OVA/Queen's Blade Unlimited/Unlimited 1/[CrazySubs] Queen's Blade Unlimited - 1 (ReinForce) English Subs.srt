1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,350
Please, give me that.

2
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,900
If you say "that" I don't understand.

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,370
Airi, come on. Answer back. What do you want?

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,220
I want your life power.

5
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,550
It isn't a simple life power, right?

6
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,400
I want your precious and radiant life power.

7
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,900
I can't wait anymore.

8
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,000
This is your limit? It's a disappointment.

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,570
A dog would hold more.

10
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,820
Airi, what are you?

11
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,270
I'm Elina-sama's slave.

12
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,870
Without your life power, I can't live.

13
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:29,070
That's why I want your life power, please. Give to your dirty slave life power.

14
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,300
Start here.

15
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,450
Ok.

16
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,050
Let's go. Don't despair so much. You are dirty.

17
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,220
Elina-sama, if you like this, you can scream.

18
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,800
You sound very arrogant to be a slave.

19
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,620
Elina-sama...

20
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,850
Open your mouth.

21
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,850
Yes.

22
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,850
You're dirty.

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,570
When I met you three days ago, you were very arrogant.

24
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,100
But you already got used to being a slave.

25
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,800
Elina-sama... more please.

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
I don't have any other option.

27
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,450
Queen's Blade.

28
00:02:53,850 --> 00:03:00,450
That is the name that the gods gave to the battles between beautiful girls.

29
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:09,020
The Bitoushi are chosen by angels, and they're responsible to fight for their desires.

30
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:16,000
The one who loses in that battle must fulfill the desire of the winner.

31
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,750
Elina.

32
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,370
Claudette-onee-sama.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,200
So you'll go find her, huh?

34
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,050
Take it.

35
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,200
The spear of rumors?

36
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,570
The world is dangerous.

37
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,800
Didn't our father order you not to let me go out and look for her?

38
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,270
I'm weak to beer.

39
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:03,850
While I was drinking, you asked me if you could go, and I couldn't refuse the request.

40
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,220
Onee-sama...

41
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,200
Bring Leina back.

42
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,550
I'm counting on you, Elina.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,500
Leina-onee-sama...

44
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:37,550
I can't believe that you escaped from the castle and have faced each other in a battle of Queen's Blade.

45
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:46,150
I must find you before you lose the battle and fulfill a strange promise.

46
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,550
Please wait.

47
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,750
I tell you to wait!

48
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,070
Why are you running away?

49
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,920
Obviously I'll run away if you persecute me.

50
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,250
Don't you listen when I talk to you?

51
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,920
T-This is...

52
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,000
So are the things.

53
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,020
There's no doubt what that light is.

54
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,770
Although it would be dangerous to approach me.

55
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,170
I want information. I heard that you have.

56
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,620
Oh yeah?

57
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,850
I heard that you were the one with information.

58
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,300
Further...

59
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:27,900
I'm a very dangerous person capable of killing, abducting and more.

60
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,450
Still, believing in you, I came to see you alone.

61
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,020
I want information.

62
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,800
You have guts.

63
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:48,750
Leina ended up involved with a person from a Bitoushi organization.

64
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,250
This organization only seeks victory.

65
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,150
It isn't a battle that she has chosen.

66
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:00,170
His opponent is a well-known Bitoushi.

67
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,470
From the Kouya clan, Listi.

68
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:09,400
What I know is that Listi was defeated by Leina.

69
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,400
Onee-sama is incredible.

70
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,550
There was no way he would lose with a low-grade Bitoushi.

71
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:23,100
I heard that Leina, after having beaten Listi, will goes to Maramax.

72
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,720
Maramax? The place of fairy tales?

73
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,070
It isn't a place of fairy tales.

74
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,670
So it exists.

75
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:36,670
This is all I know since I can remember.

76
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,220
Wait!

77
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:45,150
If you follow the road to Maramax, you'll have a better chance of finding Leina.

78
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,370
Maramax...

79
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,170
A place where many Bitoushi are found.

80
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:04,520
The demons use the Bitoushi as their harem, it's a place full of impurity and it's cursed.

81
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,900
If something like that existed, where would it be?

82
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,500
What the hell?

83
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,820
Where do you think you are putting your face?!

84
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,870
Sorry!

85
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,500
Excuse me!

86
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,100
What things.

87
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,950
Oh? He's pretty cute.

88
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,450
Isn't here! It's terrible!

89
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,570
That!

90
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,100
Don't do that!

91
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,700
What happens? You're making strange noises.

92
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,800
O-Onee-san... give me back that.

93
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,320
Huh?

94
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,750
Give it back to me quickly or she'll reach me.

95
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,000
What is that? A beast?

96
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,820
Is she chasing you?

97
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:31,200
That boy, Michael Rivalanshiel-sama, belongs to my mistress.

98
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,800
I'm nobody's.

99
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,570
So you still don't accept being to her.

100
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,300
I don't want to hear that.

101
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:50,650
I don't know where you are from. But if you want to live, you can leave.

102
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,220
A Queen's Blade will start!

103
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,320
Michael, what do you say?

104
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,600
Huh?

105
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,920
Do you want me to save you?

106
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,250
Save me!

107
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,570
Save me, Onee-san!

108
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,400
The duty of a noble is to protect the weak, those who flee.

109
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,520
Onee-san!

110
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,020
So you define it as a connection of nobility.

111
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,520
My name is Airi, I'm a maid.

112
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,650
I accept your challenge!

113
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,900
It's a shame!

114
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,970
Sorry, but I'm not a Bitoushi!

115
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,300
I can't fight with you!

116
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,820
Have a nice day, Airi!

117
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,820
Please wait!

118
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,650
If Michael-sama is taken by a Bitoushi, I would have to fight with her to perform the exchange.

119
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:04,300
Of course, the one who wins, would have the right to choose what she wants.

120
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,970
It was a perfect plan, but...

121
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,100
I can't believe that she isn't a Bitoushi.

122
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,170
Run to the port! It's a Queen's Blade!

123
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,950
Melpha against Nowa!

124
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,600
What a bad time!

125
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,270
Senal Pose!

126
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,270
Sokubako!

127
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,120
Repent!

128
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,220
There is nothing that I should repent!

129
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,850
It's delicious.

130
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,120
E-Eh... Thank you, Elina.

131
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,050
Tell me Elina-sama.

132
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,600
Yes! Elina-sama.

133
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,300
Do you think it's ok? I have many things to ask you.

134
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,820
First, why did she persecute you?

135
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,820
I don't remember it well.

136
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,300
When I woke up, I was in the woods and that girl was chasing me.

137
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,970
I don't remember anything else.

138
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,850
I saw everything half blurry.

139
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,320
Do you have amnesia?

140
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:52,070
Also, I heard a strange voice in my head.

141
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,650
It told me to find a strong Bitoushi to go to Maramax.

142
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,170
Maramax?

143
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,350
Melpha, the Senal Pose is very difficult.

144
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,970
Of course. It's something that can be done after a hard workout.

145
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:21,020
I see. I was lucky not to have fallen before it.

146
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:27,600
The Senal Pose is very shameful. I must practice more.

147
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,600
More.

148
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,920
It's easy to scare you, Melpha.

149
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,070
It's just a flute. Look.

150
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,000
What happens?

151
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,900
Nothing.

152
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,270
What is this? It's broken. It doesn't emit any sound.

153
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,900
Wonderful. That's something I can't do.

154
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,120
It was not my intention to do it.

155
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,050
Let's wash it and return it to its place.

156
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,050
I'll help you!

157
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You have to do it gently.

158
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,750
Understood.

159
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:41,170
Maybe my encounter with this boy has been predestined.

160
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,820
If I go to Maramax, I will surely find Onee-sama.

161
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,800
I have to believe and follow.

162
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:53,520
Fine! I already decided. I'll be a Bitoushi and I will protect you.

163
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,350
Huh? Its aspect...

164
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,420
It's getting bigger.

165
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,270
It seems that it has a strange power.

166
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,270
Is it a bad power?

167
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:14,120
No. The master of this flute has a strong life power.

168
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,300
Calm down! Calm down, me!

169
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,470
This is nothing!

170
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,070
So it can become so big.

171
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,300
It's clean now.

172
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,570
Leave it in the highest basket.

173
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,150
Hey! Are you ok?

174
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,170
-Amazing! 
-You can't see, Nowa-san!

175
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,100
Enough! Bring a towel!

176
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,150
What's up with this flute?

177
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,620
I don't know.

178
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,770
Why do you make strange moans?

179
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,370
I told you to stop!

180
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,470
Don't!

181
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,500
Do it again.

182
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,800
Dared.

183
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,920
Please. It seems that I'm going to remember something.

184
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,770
Play it.

185
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,900
That flute is Cathedral.

186
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:10,300
When it's played and my body is near, the key to Maramax is activated.

187
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,820
Cathedral should only be played when you want to go to Maramax.

188
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,900
I saw the road to Maramax!

189
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,250
What happens?

190
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,750
It was a life power with good flavor.

191
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,720
I'll return Michael and Mateki Cathedral to my mistress.

192
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,120
Well, have a nice night.

193
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,500
Turning your back on your enemy is a great oversight.

194
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,850
It must be a joke! Do you still have life power?

195
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,400
Yes of course. By the way, let's fix things.

196
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,070
What is this?

197
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:42,050
Fine! I'm sorry to interrupt you! I'm an elite angel, Nanael-sama! Here I introduce myself!

198
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,770
You're lucky.

199
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:52,000
One that wants to get something and another with the courage to defend it! They are apt to be Bitoushi!

200
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,300
Angel Nanael?

201
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,720
Elina-sama, take it.

202
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,770
Play it!

203
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,950
My power...

204
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:24,070
Hey, I'm talking seriously. Do you hear me?

205
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:29,320
Eh... Elina Vance, do you want to be a Bitoushi?

206
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:41,350
Understood! In the name of Nanael, I turn you into a Bitoushi!

207
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,200
Airi, now I'm proposing you a duel.

208
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,350
It's what I wanted!

209
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,820
I'll start the battle!

210
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,920
Putting your titles as Bitoushi into fight, say your wish!

211
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,300
Wish?

212
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,020
My wish is that Elina doesn't get involved with Michael again.

213
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,620
My wish...

214
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,100
Come on, decide fast.

215
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,070
I'll decide after winning.

216
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,120
Is that possible?!

217
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,850
I don't know. But I'm the one who decides!

218
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,850
That's why...!

219
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,700
Queen's Blade, start!

220
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,450
How reckless!

221
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,120
Michael, stay behind.

222
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,400
Let's go! Show me a good battle!

223
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,670
Bitoushi, show me everything without holding back, fight to get your wishes!

224
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,800
I don't plan on doing what you say!

225
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,400
You are very naive. You can't hurt me with that weapon.

226
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,670
This spear...

227
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:12,000
Coming from a powerful sanctuary, it's the weapon that carries a lot of feelings.

228
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:19,220
With Claudette's prayers, this spear possesses all of Elina's wrath inside.

229
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,070
Can you face the power of this spear?

230
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,470
I'll not let you do it again!

231
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,670
It's time to end with this!

232
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,470
Ability of the Vance legacy! Ougi!

233
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,770
Ryuusei!

234
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,850
Take this!

235
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:55,750
I can't believe that I'm losing...

236
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,670
Well, it's over!

237
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,750
Choose your wish, winner.

238
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,750
Fine...

239
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,720
Then, you are forbidden to receive life power from any other person than me.

240
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,520
The orders of the Queen's Blade winner are absolute.

241
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,100
And if I oppose the orders, I'll have to fight against Nanael.

242
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,800
I'll also stop being Bitoushi.

243
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,820
I agree.

244
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,800
Well done.

245
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,750
Then I'm leaving. Keep having good fights!

246
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,350
Bye bye!

247
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,570
Come, I'll give you life power.

248
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,270
Lift your face.

249
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,470
This is...

250
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,650
This is the proof of your loyalty to me.

251
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,550
Now you're my slave.

252
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:17,350
If you force to leave, it will hurt. And the chains weigh, so that's fine.

253
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,050
We'll go to Maramax.

254
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,320
You can also come with us.

255
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:31,250
Well, if you can live without my life power, you don't have to come.

256
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,020
Understood.

257
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,750
Before that, we should bathe again.

258
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,750
We sweat a lot.

259
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,250
I'll wash your back, Elina-sama.

260
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,900
You'll enter alone!

261
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,250
F-Fine.

262
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,670
It's very heavy...

263
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,900
There's no other option. I don't have a horse.

264
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,720
I had a good idea!

265
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,570
Elina-sama, don't you want to train?

266
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:38,270
If you do, you can travel even without these things.

267
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:42,650
Denied. To be able to make jokes you must wear the maid costume.
